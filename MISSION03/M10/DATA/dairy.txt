The "->" symbol can refer to a programming operator or a symbol for direction and logic, depending on the context. In C/C++, it is the arrow operator, used to access members of a struct or union through a pointer, and it is equivalent to dereferencing the pointer with * and then using the dot operator ., for example, ptr->member is the same as (*ptr).member. Outside of programming, it can simply be a right arrow symbol, used to indicate direction or as a logical connective.
